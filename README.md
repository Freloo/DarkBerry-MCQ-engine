This project is a MCQ engine to create and participate at MCQ create by other people. This project is now to a beta version.
I join the file of alpha.exe in a few time because now I have not question in the MCQ. 

I will upload the beta version today !


The beta version add the possibility of create qcm without the c# program but it is limited to 5 mcq, qnd the MCQ is deleted when you close the app, and the programm don't ignored the caps like the alpha version.
